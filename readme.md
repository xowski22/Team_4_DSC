## Overview

Team 4's solution for the [Kaggle Product Recommendation Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/product-recommendation-challenge/overview).

**Challenge Overview:**
This is a collaborative filtering recommendation system challenge where we predict which products users will interact with based on historical user-item interactions and product metadata.
