# Team 4 @ DSC Recruitment Challenge - Product Recommendation Challenge

## Overview

Team 4's solution for the [Kaggle Product Recommendation Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/product-recommendation-challenge/overview).

**Challenge Overview:**
This is a collaborative filtering recommendation system challenge where we predict which products users will interact with based on historical user-item interactions and product metadata.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files. Initially empty, populated by `download-data.sh`.
- `docs/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis and documentation.
  - `data-structure.ipynb`: Detailed exploration of the dataset structure.
  - `eda.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis.
  - `evaluation.ipynb`: Notebook for evaluating models.
- `src/`: Contains the source code.
  - `evaluation.py`: Script for model evaluation.
- `download-data.sh`: Script to download the dataset from Kaggle.
- `readme.md`: This file.

## Dataset Structure
- `train.csv`: User-item interactions with ratings and timestamps
- `test.csv`: Users for whom we need to make predictions  
- `item_metadata.csv`: Product information including categories, prices, descriptions
- `id_mappings.json`: Mappings between original IDs and encoded numeric IDs
- `sample_submission.csv`: Expected submission format (top 10 item recommendations per user)
